        <p>A Goldendoodle, also known as the Groodle, is bred from a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. 
            First widely bred in 1990s, the crossbreed is bred in three different size varieties 
            corresponding to the size variety of Poodle used as a parent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldendoodle">wikipedia</a></p>

            <h3>Fun Facts about Doodle Dogs <a href="https://www.pumpkin.care/blog/19-amazing-facts-about-goldendoodles/">prrs&wags</a></h3> 
            <p>It’s claimed that Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, bred the first cross between a Golden Retriever and 
                a Poodle in 1969. This hybrid didn’t become popular then, but it sure took off in the 1990s! In the 1960s, the Labradoodle and 
                Cockapoo gained popularity as guide dogs for people with visual impairment. Later on, service dog trainers requested a larger dog, 
                and Breeders answered the call by combining the Golden Retriever’s sunny disposition with the Poodle’s intelligence and propensity 
                for low shedding. The dogs they produced are kind, intelligent, allergy-friendly, and larger than both of their predecessors.</p>
